# Visualization
This repository showcases various data visualization techniques using Python's data analysis libraries. The visualizations include heat maps, histograms, scatter plots, and bar graphs, with the aim of exploring and understanding patterns in a cars dataset.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about cars, such as:

miles per gallon : this column gives information about the milage of the car.
cylinders : this columns will let you know about the engine type of the car, how much cylinder engine that car posses.
cubicinches : this column will give you the information about the engine size in cubic centimetres.
hp : this column gives information about the horse power of the engine.
weightlbs : weight of the car in pounds.
time-to-60 : this column will give you the information about the time is sec to pick the speed of 60 miles per hour.
Year : this columns will give you the manufacturing year of that car.
brand : give you the information about the company of that car.

The dataset can be found in the data/ directory of this repository.

we mainly use these four plots while analyzing the data.  

Heat Map
A heat map is used to visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset, helping to identify relationships between different features. For example, it can show how engine size and horsepower are related.

Histogram
Histograms are used to display the distribution of a single numeric variable, such as the distribution of car weights or MPG.

Scatter Plot
Scatter plots are employed to observe the relationship between two numeric variables, like horsepower vs. MPG, allowing us to see potential trends.

Bar Graph
Bar graphs are useful for visualizing categorical data, such as the count of cars from different countries or the number of cars with different numbers of cylinders.
